# Physics Props
Player will be given many physics based toys. A system for placing and arranging prop pieces will be necessary.

Player should be able to select a prop from a list to spawn into the scene, as well as remove from the scene. Manipulation of the prop doesn't need to be too advanced... Just position and rotation. Provide gizmos along with multi-touch shortcuts.
