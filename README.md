# Toybox
A Virtual Space for Android where players are presented with virtual toys. Toys should all be fairly unique, and are ultimately bi-products of the joy of developing them. This Project also serves as a playground for trying out different features and functions of both Android SDK and Godot Engine.

Made with Godot 4.1.3-stable

## What is a "Toy"
I think it would be best to define what a Toy is to this project, and all the extra functions it would require to make it a cohesive and understandable.

In the case of this project, a Toy is; 
 - An interactive object. 
 - It most likely will be 3D. 
 - It can have a setting or stage where it's played with if needed. 
   - Table 
   - Box
   - Tub of water 
 - A Toy should not ever load in an entire environment, that would just be a video game. 
 - A Toy can be an object that has a video game on it, akin to very old key-chain games.
 - It does NOT require;
   - Points
   - Timers
   - Conventional Physics
	 - Try to explain or frame unconventional physics in some way.
